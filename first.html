      <p> In this excercise we are to create a website on our interests!!! </p>
       One of my <span class="specific"><u>interests</u></span> are comics!
      <p> My favorite franchise is DC comics. The reason why is because it is a
        series of comics that basically depict a group of beings that have god-like
        talent and powers and describes their struggles of wanting a normal life. </p>
